# Pre-requisites: installing the compiler #
Here I assume you use `QtCreator` and the Apple compiler

  * Install xcode from app store
  * Download & Install latest QtSDK for OSX
    * personalize install type, make sure include `QtCreator`
  * Install xcode command line tools
    * (create an apple developer account)
    * open /Applications/XCode
    * xcode (menu) -> Open Developer Tools -> More Developer Tools...
    * It should send you to [link](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
    * Search for the latest "Command Line Tools (OSX your version) for xcode MONTH DATE"
    * Download and install the package

# Compiling #
  * open /Applications/Terminal.app
  * browse with your terminal to starlab root folder
  * `user @ machine ~/Developer/starlab: open starlab-full.pro`
